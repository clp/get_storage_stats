Revision history for Parse-StorageArrayLog

0.01    Mon2011_0822
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    Tue2011_0823_17:51
        Built two regex's to find seven of the eight fields 
        for the o/p stream.

0.04    Wed2011_0824_19:56 
        All functions working, o/p data looks good.
        Changed data structure to key on volname instead of
        hostname, since one host can have multiple volumes.

        Use pattern matching to link volname and hostname.

0.05    Fri2011_0826_14:39 
        Sort the output based on hostname, then LUN.
        Prior sort based on volname did not handle numeric
        suffixes when they included both 1 and 2 digits.

        Prior approach of using pattern matching to link 
        volname and hostname did not apply when the two 
        names had nothing in common, so that was abandoned.
